Dual supervised learning for sentiment analysis.

The dual learning code for images and NMT can be found in our internal git.

The models are at:
  server: msraml-srv25
  location: D:\Users\v-yixia\Dual_SentimentAnalysis\winning_models
  
  
You can refer to "train.bat" and "valid.bat" for how to run our code.
